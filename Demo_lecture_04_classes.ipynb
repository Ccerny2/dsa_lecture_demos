For example, you could use a gamma distribution (k=4, theta=0.25) to model the treatment time (capped to 4 hours). The next patient to be treated is the most urgent and, if multiple patients with the same level of urgency exist, the one that has been waiting the longest.\n",

        "##### Objectives\n",
        "The objective of the test is to build a simple code (using **an objected oriented framework and a modular design**) which is able to simulate the waiting time along a day (24 hours).\n",
        "The code should be able to simulate the evolution of the waiting time along the day depending on how many doctors are available. The code should also contain commands to plot the average waiting time after 24 hours by doctors.\n",
        "Furthermore, write the code to calculate how many doctors are needed to ensure that in 99% of the cases no patient waits more than 3 hours and provide the answer."
